This files containes the project made for during a one month  artificial internship internship program at Encrpytix .
The Projects are:
TICTACTOE AI : an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax without Alpha-Beta Pruning . This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.
RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM: Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.
IMAGE CAPTIONING :Combined computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions for those images.
